overview:
the code is about catching a fox, and seeing the colors change on the cube in the center

manipulations:
click on the translating, rotating and scaling boxes to reveal the remaining foxes
go around the chess board to remove the foxes
click on the square int he center to manipulate its color and reveal a fox

what was challenging:
everything!!!! the entire assisngment (the technical side) was very difficult, expecailly because of the github thing. 
my repository wouldn't push no matter how much i pushed, and it woudn't pull no matter how hard i pulled. :D it was a mess.
I had to manually put every thing in. (I'm being honest) I don't know if you will duck marks for this. but i really need help
in getting it work for the next assignment.

what went well:
using 3d assets was fun and I could express myself in the assignment. i was also able to add animations to the 3D assets.
