Overview
my game features 8 cards. each player has to click the cards to defuse a bomb
I chose this design because it was simple yet, interesting.

MODES AVAILABLE: 
[before you change to another mode, please restart app.js]
*competitive mode: each player has to click all the cards on their screen, to get the most points and win.
*cooperative mode: each player has to work together to pick the right card. if either of them select the wrong card they both loose.
competitive mode --> localhost:8080/competitive	
cooperative mode --> localhost:8080/cooperative	



Challenging
	*working with websocket was new and difficult
	*working with the timer was irritating because it kept printing 
		(which i needed it to do, but it was disrupting from the other info)
	*trying to have the game work with the right html page for who won or who lost.

What Went Well
	* i was able to get the players to compete against each other.
	* i was able to total the points of each player to see if they won or lost.
	* i was able to understand how to use websocket
